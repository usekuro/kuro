# UseKuro Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of key features to fix the "Mock definition not found" error and add workspace management functionality to the UseKuro mock server project.

## üéØ Problems Solved

### 1. Mock Definition Error
**Problem**: When creating mocks from the frontend, users encountered `{"error":"Mock definition not found"}` error when trying to start mocks.

**Root Cause**: User-created mocks lacked proper mock definitions, causing the server to fail when attempting to start them.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic mock definition generation based on protocol type.

### 2. Missing Workspace Management
**Problem**: No way to manage multiple user workspaces or organize mocks by user.

**Solution**: Added complete workspace management system with create, switch, and delete functionality.

### 3. Example Mock Protection & Individual Mock Management
**Problem**: Users could accidentally delete or modify example mocks, losing reference templates. Also needed granular control to delete individual mocks without affecting others.

**Solution**: Clear separation between example mocks (read-only) and user mocks (fully editable), with protection against deletion of examples. Added individual mock deletion for precise workspace management.

## üîß Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`internal/web/server.go`)

#### 1. Automatic Mock Definition Generation
```go
func (s *Server) generateMockDefinition(protocol string, port int, name, description string) *schema.MockDefinition
```

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Creates default routes with JSON responses
- **SFTP**: Sets up authentication and sample file structure
- **TCP**: Configures echo-style message handling
- **WebSocket**: Implements ping-pong message handling

#### 2. Enhanced User Mock Creation
```go
func (s *Server) handleCreateUserMock(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

- Auto-generates mock definitions for all protocols
- Adds mocks to both persistent storage and runtime
- Enables immediate mock start/stop functionality

#### 3. Workspace Management Endpoints
```go
// New endpoints added:
GET    /api/workspaces                    // List all workspaces
POST   /api/user/{userID}/workspace      // Create new workspace
DELETE /api/user/{userID}/workspace      // Delete workspace
```

#### 4. Enhanced Mock Deletion with Protection & Individual Control
```go
func (s *Server) handleUserMock(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

- **Individual Mock Deletion**: Delete specific user mocks without affecting others
- **Example Protection**: Protects example mocks from deletion (returns 403 Forbidden)
- **User Mock Management**: Only allows deletion of user-created mocks (with `user_` prefix)
- **Runtime Cleanup**: Properly stops running mocks before deletion
- **Storage Cleanup**: Cleans up both runtime and persistent storage
- **Protocol Support**: Handles all protocol types (HTTP, SFTP, TCP, WebSocket)
- **Workspace Isolation**: Only affects mocks in current workspace

### Frontend Changes (`web/index.html`)

#### 1. Enhanced Workspace Management UI
- Added "Workspaces" button in User Workspace tab
- Modal interface for workspace operations
- Current workspace indicator
- Protected workspace handling
- Clear separation of example mocks vs user mocks
- Visual indicators for mock types (Example/User badges)

#### 2. Enhanced Mock Display and Creation
- Improved error handling for mock creation
- Better feedback for successful operations
- Automatic refresh after operations
- Separated display of example mocks (read-only) and user mocks (editable)
- Clear visual distinction between mock types
- Enhanced tooltips and descriptions

#### 3. New API Integration
```javascript
// Added workspace management APIs
getWorkspaces: () => fetch("/api/workspaces"),
createWorkspace: (userID) => fetch(`/api/user/${userID}/workspace`, { method: "POST" }),
deleteWorkspace: (userID) => fetch(`/api/user/${userID}/workspace`, { method: "DELETE" }),
```

### Persistence Layer (`internal/persistence/mockstore.go`)

#### 1. Enhanced Mock Storage
- Automatic .kuro file generation
- Metadata persistence with JSON
- Protocol-specific content generation

#### 2. Workspace Management
```go
func (ms *MockStore) CreateUserWorkspace(userID string) error
```

- Creates complete directory structure
- Initializes user configuration
- Sets up mock, config, and upload directories

## üåü Key Features Implemented

### 1. Protocol-Specific Mock Templates

#### HTTP/HTTPS Mocks
```yaml
protocol: http
port: 8080
routes:
  - path: /
    method: GET
    response:
      status: 200
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
      body: |
        {"message": "Hello from Mock", "status": "ok"}
```

#### SFTP Mocks
```yaml
protocol: sftp
port: 2222
sftpAuth:
  username: "usekuro"
  password: "kuro123"
files:
  - path: "/welcome.txt"
    content: "Welcome to SFTP server!"
  - path: "/data/sample.json"
    content: '{"server": "mock", "protocol": "sftp"}'
```

#### TCP Mocks
```yaml
protocol: tcp
port: 9999
onMessage:
  match: ".*"
  conditions:
    - if: "HELLO"
      respond: "HELLO from Mock"
  else: "Echo: {{message}}"
```

#### WebSocket Mocks
```yaml
protocol: websocket
port: 8088
onMessage:
  match: ".*"
  conditions:
    - if: "ping"
      respond: "pong from Mock"
  else: "Echo: {{message}}"
```

### 2. Workspace Management

#### Workspace Structure
```
workspaces/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default/           # Protected default workspace (example mocks)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mocks/         # Example mock definitions (read-only)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/       # Example configurations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json    # Default workspace settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userID}/          # User workspaces (isolated)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mocks/         # User mock definitions (editable)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/       # User configurations
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/       # File uploads
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exports/       # Exported files
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json    # User settings
```

#### Workspace Features
- **Create**: Generate new isolated workspaces for users
- **Switch**: Change active workspace context
- **Delete Workspace**: Remove entire user workspace and all contents (preserves example mocks)
- **Delete Individual Mocks**: Remove specific user mocks without affecting others
- **Protection**: Example mocks cannot be deleted or modified (individual or bulk)
- **Separation**: Clear distinction between example and user mocks
- **Granular Control**: Precise mock management at individual level
- **Statistics**: Track mocks by protocol, source, and creation date
